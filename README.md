Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develo-s financial plans its clients. They are seeking to update their operations by modernizing their software security. They wish to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. They wish to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

The most successful part of the project for me was updating the versions of Springboot and Maven that Artemis was using. Both were outdated and leading to many vulnerable dependencies. It is important to code securely because insecure code can lead to data loss and consumer doubt in your organization. By providing a secure environment, customers will trust your company more and be more willing to use your services.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I always struggle with manual code review. I find that to be the most difficult. I do not trust myself or my instincts. I am always secondguessing if what I am honing in on is correct. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased security in this project by adding ciphers and a selfsigned C to secure the connection. Dependency checkers are something that I found really useful in this project and I will continue to use them in the future. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I madesure that the code was functional by running it several times. I was able to ensure that the code was secure, without vulnerabilities by using best practices and writing secure code. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

As stated above, I found the dependency checker through Maven to be quite useful. I will certainly reference this as a great tool. I would show them the screenshot from the web browser showing the secure webpage.
